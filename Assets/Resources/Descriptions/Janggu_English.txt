Janggu (Traditional Drum)

The Janggu is a traditional Korean percussion instrument shaped like an hourglass. It produces different tones: one side creates low pitches, while the other produces high pitches. Played with both hands, it is essential for maintaining rhythm in traditional Korean music, dances, and pansori.

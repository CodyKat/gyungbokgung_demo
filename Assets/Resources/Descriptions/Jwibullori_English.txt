Jwibullori (Fire-Spinning Game)

Jwibullori is a traditional folk game played during Jeongwol Daeboreum, the first full moon of the lunar year. Participants swing cans filled with burning materials to ward off pests in rice fields. The game also serves as a communal event to wish for a bountiful harvest.
